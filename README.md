# TimingComparator (for Fabric)
Compare timings of trapdoor activations to see how fast your redstone circuits run on client-side. 

## About
Sends client a message when more than one iron trapdoor is activated or deactivated at the same time. This mod is client-side and can be used on online servers with no other dependencies. 

## Usage
Put an iron trapdoor on output of the circuit and another trapdoor connected to your input, then try to synchronize the trapdoors using repeater and read how many ticks it takes for your circuit to run. *In the demonstration, circuit runs in **2 redstone ticks**.*
